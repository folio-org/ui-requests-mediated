## Run your new app

Run the following from the ui-requests-mediated directory to serve your new app using a development server:
```
stripes serve
```

Note: When serving up a newly created app that does not have its own backend permissions established, pass the `--hasAllPerms` option to display the app in the UI navigation. For example:
```
stripes serve --hasAllPerms
```

To specify your own tenant ID or to use an Okapi instance other than `http://localhost:9130` pass the `--okapi` and `--tenant` options.
```
stripes serve --okapi http://my-okapi.example.com:9130 --tenant my-tenant-id
```

## Run the tests

Run the included UI tests with the following command:
```
yarn run test:jest"
```
